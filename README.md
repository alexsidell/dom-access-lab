# DOM Access "Menu" Homework

## Intro

This homework does something that is not very typical of real websites but demonstrates the power of DOM manipulation: we are going to build a menu bar with a slide-down submenu using only javascript and DOM manipulation.

> Note:  Several of the tasks in this lab would be better done upfront in the markup or CSS instead of using JS, however the goal of this lab is to provide practice modifying the DOM using JS. In your projects, if the HTML or CSS is known in advance and/or static (unchanging), code it in HTML and CSS!

### This lab is required

## Setup

this is a change

1. Clone this repository, and then open it in VSCode
  
2. Create an index.html and style.css and populate the html with the standard boilerplate.
  
3. Also, create a script.js file

5. Update the `<body>` element in the **index.html** to this:

	```html
	<body>
	  <header>
	    <nav id="top-menu"></nav>
	  </header>
	  <main></main>
	
	  <script src="script.js"></script>
	</body>
	```

	> Note: The markup is complete - **DO NOT** modify it in any way - do not add any classes. (You can only **add id attributes**)

6. Add the following CSS within **style.css**:

	```css
	* {
	  box-sizing: border-box;
	}
	
	/* CSS Custom Properties */
	:root {
	  --main-bg: #4a4e4d;
	  --top-menu-bg: #0e9aa7;
	  --sub-menu-bg: #3da4ab;
	}
	
	body {
	  font-family: Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif;
	  height: 100vh;
	  margin: 0;
	  display: grid;
	  grid-template-rows: 3rem auto;
	  color: white;
	}
	
	.flex-ctr {
	  display: flex;
	  justify-content: center;
	  align-items: center;
	}
	
	.flex-around {
	  display: flex;
	  justify-content: space-around;
	  align-items: center;
	}
	
	nav a {
	  line-height: 3rem;
	  padding: 0 1rem;
	  text-transform: uppercase;
	  text-decoration: none;
	  color: white;
	}
	
	#top-menu a:hover {
	  background-color: var(--sub-menu-bg);
	}
	```

	> Note: The CSS is complete - **DO NOT** modify it in any way.
	
	Optional: Take five minutes to familiarize yourself with [CSS Custom Properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - they are an amazing new addition to CSS. If you're familiar with using variables with SASS/LESS pre-processors, CSS Custom Properties are similar, but far more powerful because they are dynamic (their values can be changed during runtime) - and they are built into the CSS language!

## Tasks

#### Task 1.0

Select and cache the `<main>` element in a variable named `mainEl`. Console.log this to verify that you have succeeded in caching the object.

**Hint:** (you may use document.querySelector or document.getElementById)

#### Task 1.1

Set the background color of `mainEl` to "#4a4e4d". 

(Hint: modify the style property of your mainEl variable.)

#### Task 1.2

Set the content of `mainEl` to `<h1>SEI Rocks!</h1>`.

#### Task 1.3

Add a class of `flex-ctr` to `mainEl`.

**Hint:** [Element.classList API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList)

#### Progress Check:

#### Task 2.0

Select and cache the `<nav id="top-menu">` element in a variable named `topMenuEl`.

#### Task 2.1

Set the height `topMenuEl` element to be `100%`.

#### Task 2.2

Set the background color of `topMenuEl` to the value stored in the `--top-menu-bg` CSS custom property.

#### Task 2.3

Add a class of `flex-around` to `topMenuEl`.

#### Progress Check:

# ALL done! #

#### Task 3.0 (very very very optional - as we haven't covered arrays yet)

Copy the following data structure to the top of **script.js**:

```js
// Menu data structure
var menuLinks = [
  {text: 'about', href: '/about'},
  {text: 'catalog', href: '/catalog'},
  {text: 'orders', href: '/orders'},
  {text: 'account', href: '/account'},
];
```

#### Task 3.1 (very very very optional - as we haven't covered arrays yet)

Write a loop to iterate over the entire `menuLinks` array and for each "link" object:

- Create an `<a>` element.

- On the new element, add an `href` attribute with its value set to the `href` property of the "link" object.

- Set the new element's content to the value of the `text` property of the "link" object.

- Append the new element to the `topMenuEl` element.

#### Congrats!
